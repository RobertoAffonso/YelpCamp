This is a Campgrounds RestFUL CRUD app built using Node.js, Express, Bootstrap 3 and Mongo.db for data persistence. Features data persistence, account login and full crud functionality

It was built in order to practice my Javascript skills, in the future i might update it with the following features:

<ul>
  <li>Migrate to Bootstrap 4</li>
  <li>Add an Admin role</li>
  <li>Translate the main messages according to the user locale</li>
  <li>Add payment options</li>
  <li>Integrate Google Maps</li>
  <li>Change currency form according to the user locale</li>
  <li>Sign in using OAuth2</li>
</ul>
